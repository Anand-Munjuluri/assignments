// The regular expression /\s+/g is used in JavaScript to match one or more whitespace characters in a string. Here's a breakdown of the components:

// /: The beginning and ending forward slashes denote the start and end of the regular expression literal in JavaScript.
// \s: This represents any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
// +: This quantifier means "one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group." In this case, it indicates one or more whitespace characters.
// g: This is the global flag, indicating that the regular expression should be applied globally to the entire string, rather than stopping after the first match.
// So, /\s+/g will match any sequence of one or more whitespace characters in a string. When used with the replace method, it replaces these sequences with a single space.
